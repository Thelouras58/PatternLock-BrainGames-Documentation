## v1.0.0 - [May 14, 2022] (Open Beta)

Pattern Lock Brain Games is my first personal production project.
It’s an Android application that incudes a mini-game collection that requires a variety of thinking skills.
The games are divided into 3 different categories: Problem Solving, Memory and Brain Processing Speed.

The beta version includes two games: Draw the Number and Remember the Pattern and some UI/UX experiments.

**Draw the Numbers** – your job is to reproduce a combination of numbers in the Pattern Lock as quickly and accurately as possible. You can have three levels of difficulty and compare your best times with your friend.

**Remember the Pattern** – in this game you have to remember a pattern that you will be shown for a short period of time. The longer you play, the more complicated it becomes. Be careful not to make any mistakes!
