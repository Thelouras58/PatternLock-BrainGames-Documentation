**Draw the Numbers** – your job is to reproduce a combination of numbers in the Pattern Lock as quickly and accurately as possible. You can have three levels of difficulty and compare your best times with your friend.

**Remember the Pattern** – in this game you have to remember a pattern that you will be shown for a short period of time. The longer you play, the more complicated it becomes. Be careful not to make any mistakes!
